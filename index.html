  My Favorite Hobby 
  </h1>
<h2>
  Learning
  </h2>
  <p>
  My favorite hobby is learning new things such as new words or facts. You can learn anything, from a new word to a new game, to a new craft. Learning is benifitial because it can help you maintain a happy and stable life. Learning also gives you money and makes yourself dependent. Google says learning can also make your dreams come true! Learning helps you especially when you are a kid like me. I am 10 years old and I am learning in the 5th standard. It will help a lot to those who have not yet completed collage. Learning is very benefitial in life. It will make you successful.
